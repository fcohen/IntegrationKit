<h1>A Free Evaluation Guide for Serverless, Microservices and Integration Development Platforms</h1>
<h2>Compares TIBCO, Redhat Jboss, Spring Boot, Mulesoft</h2>

Would it surprise you that choosing TIBCO is 12% more efficient at developer productivity than Spring Boot - - and 23% over Jboss, 20% over Mulesoft. And, the cost over time, as your developers make changes to apps/services, TIBCO is 30% more efficient at engineering costs than Spring Boot - - and 30% over Jboss, and 13% over Mulesoft.

For the past 8 years noted development expert Frank Cohen, founder at Appvance, updated and published the PushToTest Integration Knowledge Kit. The Kit is a free open-source competitive evaluation guide comparing TIBCO, Redhat Jboss, Spring Boot, Mulesoft, and many others.

The Kit helps you evaluate the developer productivity and performance of building services on integration platforms and deploying services to serverless, microservices, Cloud and AWS Lambda. The free Kit includes:

* Executive Summary slide deck - 20 pages, describes project, methodology and results
* In-Depth Summary slide deck - 70 pages, explains the details on each platform
* TCO model/spreadsheet - Excel XLS formatted spreadsheet off the observed time to implement
* And 4 Developer Journals explaining step-by-step what our engineers encountered and how they worked around the problems for TIBCO, Spring Boot, Mulesoft, and Redhat JBoss.
Full source code of the 4 implementations

The Kit is ideal for architectures needed for DeepLearning, Blockchain applications, and Cloud apps. The Kit implements the same Sports Betting use case across all the modern platforms. It uses Docker, Openshift, and Kubernetes containers. It uses HTML5, Node.js, Reactjs, Webdev coding. It deploys microservices and AWS Lambda services to the Cloud.  And follows industry standards for DevOps, Agile, and source code documentation. Plus the Kit is 100% open source and free for you to use.
